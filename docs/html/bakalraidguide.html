I will take it into consideration for planning.</li>
            <li>I plan the schedule for the benefit of most people possible, if you are not in it, may it be time, character strength, coordination with the rest... Reasons could be many, deal with it, pm me (Nichika#6934) if you have any questions.</li>
            <li>Feedback is the most important thing here, suggestions, need to complain about how the raid went, need to complain about someone, etc..., send it to me. I will guarantee your privacy and try to fix them at the best of my abilities.</li>
            <li>Please leave your feelings at the door before entering, we are here to <b>CLEAR</b> the raid, if shit goes down, I need as much info as possible in order to fix them, being angry or sad will not help me or the others.</li>
            <li>If you are unhappy with the raid, need a break, or do not wish to stay here, you may leave whenever you want, nothing personal will be taken. This <b>is a GAME</b>, your life is more important than that and no one will judge you for that, do what you think it's best for you.</li>

        <h2>Bakal raid planning</h2>
        <p class="break"></p>
        <p>The raid is a single phase "just drop Bakal's hp to 0% or lose if his fury reaches 100%", plain and simple. For the planning, I will divide the raid into 2 phases, each team will have different roles depending on which phase it is. This is the simple format of how things will be ran</p>
        <p>The colors of the creatures will be <b class="text-danger">Hard</b> <b class="text-warning">Medium</b> <b class="text-success">Easy</b> difficulties, clicking on them will send you to the dfoarchive page of that boss</p>

            <li class="text-success">Green team: Obtain buffs, defeat gatekeepers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The logic here is simple, rotate Red and Yellow between defeating the main dragons and lower Bakal's hp, Green will be the gate openers after they retreat from Bakal, Green team will be the firefighters now</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <ol>
            <li>VERY IMPORTANT: Check with Green team first, if they can hold on for the time it takes Yellow to defeat a gatekeeper, Green stays, repeat Yellow defeating gatekeeper and Red entering main dragon, if they can't, Green will retreat, Yellow will enter Bakal</li>
            <li>Green's role will now defeating buff minibosses and gatekeepers</li>
            <li>While Yellow is in Bakal, Red will defeat a buff boss, Green will defeat gatekeeper of the next awakened dragon</li>
            <li>Red will enter main dragon once gatekeeper is defeated</li>
            <li>Check with Yellow team, if they need to retreat, Green will enter, if they can stay, Green will defeat a buff boss</li>
            <li>Once Red is done with the main dragon, Yellow will retreat and Red will enter Bakal</li>
            <li>Yellow opens the next gatekeeper, Green keeps defeating buff bosses</li>
            <li>Once the last main dragon is open, Red will retreat from Bakal and enter the main dragon, Yellow will enter Bakal</li>
            <li>If Red fails to clear main dragon, Green enters, Red clears buffs until they are ready to enter Bakal</li>
            <li>Rotate Red and Yellow in Bakal, Green team and the team that's not fighting Bakal will continue clearing buffs</li>

    <div class="row">
        <h2>Important notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It has only been mentioned once at the start but, DEFEAT TROOPERS BEFORE ENTERING ANY DUNGEON, THEY CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO REACH ANY CAMP</li>
            <li>The reason why the team defeating the gatekeepers will not enter the main dragon, is because the gatekeepers, other than Petrilisk, must be MERCILESSLY BURSTED WITH MAXIMUM POWER and DEALT WITH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, they have the worst gimmicks and it gets worse as time goes on. Rule for all the teams, enter gatekeeper if your sader's 3a is ready or soon</li>
            <li>Go back to any of the 3 bases after fighting a gatekeeper that's not Petrilisk or main dragon</li>
            <li>Always check in with the team fighting Bakal, he must never be idle, there will be always a team inside</li>
            <li>Failsafes will happen often, as it is not expected that red team kills the main dragon in one go, always stay alert</li>
            <li>I have not mentioned when to use commander buffs, read them in the dfo archive guide and see for yourself when is the best time to use them</li>
            <li>Communicate with your party lead, info is the key to victory</li>
            <li>Lemidios bless dfo archive, long may it live</li>
